# ufo-data-analysis

The repo to my Data Science Project about analysing UFO data.
The data is from kaggle [click here to see](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings).


# general 

The date primariely consicsts of US sightings. It's from 1910-2014.

It is visible that the Ufo sightings are often near airports... 

# visualisation 
The primary dashboard is the website showing a map of the sightings and some general analysis of the data.

The general analysis is about the fequenzy in the states and years, also about the shapes. 


There is also the notebook inspecting the data for the visualisation.

the most interesting visualisation is about UFOs that have been seen multiple times. so you can choose the days and distance to see if there are similar sightings
